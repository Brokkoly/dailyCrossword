# DailyCrossword

- Just a little script for printing out the LA Times crossword puzzle automatically that turned into a way to learn puppeteer.
- I'm not sure if this is the most efficient way of doing this but loading the puzzle I was able to get via the api turned out to be troublesome.
- I am not affiliated with the LA Times. This project is just for printing out the puzzle every day

### Coming Soon
- Some sort of means of printing after I figure out how to hook my printer up to wsl or my beaglebone

### I've maybe not wasted this time if I keep printing out the crossword every day for 5 years
